//Question//

//Write a C program to check whether a given number (N) is a perfect number or not.//
//[Perfect Number - A perfect number is a positive integer number which is equals to the sum of its proper positive divisors. For example 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and it�s sum is equals to 6.]//

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int N; 
    scanf("%d",&N); 
    int i,sum=0;
for(i=1;i<N;i++)
  if(N%i==0)
   sum+=i;
 
if(sum==N)
  printf("%d is a perfect number.",N);
else
  printf("%d is not a perfect number.",N);
 
return 0;
 
}
